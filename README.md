# web-audio-player

[![experimental](http://badges.github.io/stability-badges/dist/experimental.svg)](http://github.com/badges/stability-badges)

[(demo)](http://jam3.github.io/web-audio-player/)

A simplified cross-browser WebAudio wrapper with a narrow API. This repo also attempts to report and solve some ["WebAudio Gotchas"](#webaudio-gotchas) for getting WebAudio working on mobile. It targets new browsers and devices, and does not attempt to provide a non-WebAudio fallback.

See [caniuse.com WebAudio API](http://caniuse.com/#feat=audio-api).

### Motivation

The main use case for this is to support WebAudio features (such as [reverb](https://www.npmjs.com/package/soundbank-reverb) and [frequency analysis](https://www.npmjs.com/package/web-audio-analyser)) across desktop and mobile browsers.

Currently (as of Nov 2015), on recent versions of Safari and Android Chrome, you can only take advantage of these features by buffering and decoding the entire audio file (rather than streaming it).<sup>[[1]](https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=419446)[[2]](https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=125031)</sup>

This module provides a consistent API whether you are using a media element (Chrome/FF) or buffer (other browsers) as the audio source.

### Demo

[http://jam3.github.io/web-audio-player/](http://jam3.github.io/web-audio-player/)

The demo uses [web-audio-analyser](https://github.com/hughsk/web-audio-analyser) and [analyser-frequency-average](https://github.com/Jam3/analyser-frequency-average).

The audio streams and auto-plays on desktop. On mobile, the file is buffered, then decoded, then we wait for user to initiate playback.

### Browser Support

Tested with the following browsers/devices.

- Streams Audio
  - Webkit Nightly
  - FireFox 42.0
  - Chrome 46.0
- Buffers Audio
  - Samsung Galaxy S6 (Chrome 46)
  - iOS Safari
    - iOS 9.2, iPhone 5S
    - iOS 8.3 iPad Mini Retina
  - Safari 8.0 (OSX Yosemite)
  - iOS Chrome
    - iOS 8, iPhone 6, Chrome 46
    - iOS 9.2, iPhone 5S, Chrome 45 has a [gotcha](#webaudio-gotchas) (can support streaming)
    - iOS 8.3 iPad Mini Retina (can support streaming)

### Install

Meant to be used with Browserify or Webpack.

```sh
npm install web-audio-player --save
```

### Example

A simple example for Chrome/FF, which does not attempt to solve some of the mobile challenges.

```js
var createPlayer = require('web-audio-player')

var audio = createPlayer('assets/audio.mp3')

audio.on('load', () => {
  console.log('Audio loaded...')
  
  // start playing audio file
  audio.play()
  
  // and connect your node somewhere, such as
  // the AudioContext output so the user can hear it!
  audio.node.connect(audio.context.destination)
})

audio.on('ended', () => {
  console.log('Audio ended...')
})
```

For a complete mobile/desktop demo, see [demo/index.js](demo/index.js). See [Gotchas](#webaudio-gotchas) for more details.

## Usage

[![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm/web-audio-player.png)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/web-audio-player)

#### `player = webAudioPlayer(src, [opt])`

Creates a generic audio player interface from the given `src` file path.

If `opt.buffer` is true, the audio node is created from a buffer sourceÂ (not streamed). Otherwise, it is created from a media element source (streamed). The two have different implications.

Full list of options:

- `buffer` (Boolean) whether to use a Buffer source, default false
- `loop` (Boolean) whether to loop the playback, default false
- `crossOrigin` (String) for media element sources; optional cross origin flag
- `context` (AudioContext) an audio context to use, defaults to a new context. You should re-use contexts, and also consider [ios-safe-audio-context](https://github.com/Jam3/ios-safe-audio-context)
- `element` (Audio|HTMLAudioElement) an optional element to use, defaults to creating a new one. Only applicable when `buffer` is false.

#### `player.play()`

Plays the audio. If you are using a `buffer` source, you can only call this once.

#### `player.pause()`

Stops the audio. If you are using a `buffer` source, you will need to re-load a new player to start playing the audio again.

### properties

#### `player.context`

The `AudioContext` being used for this player. You should re-use audio contexts where possible.

#### `player.node`

The `AudioNode` for this WebAudio player.

#### `player.element`

If `buffer` is false (the source is a media element), this will be the `HTMLAudioElement` or `Audio` object that is driving the audio. 

If the source is a buffer, this will be undefined.

#### `player.duration`

The duration of the audio track in seconds. This will most likely only return a meaningful value after the `'load'` event.

### events

#### `player.on('load', fn)`

Called when the player has loaded, and the audio can be played. With a media element, this is after `'canplay'`. With a buffer source, this is after the audio has been decoded.

#### `player.on('end', fn)`

If the audio is not looping, this is called when the audio playback ends.

#### `player.on('error', fn)`

Called with `(err)` parameters when there was an error loading, buffering or decoding the audio.

#### `player.on('decoding', fn)`

If `buffer: true`, this will be called after the XMLHttpRequest, and before `decodeAudioData` starts. This alows you to provide an update to your user as the audio loads.

This is not called with a media element source.

## Dependencies

If you're using buffer mode and a browser [that doesn't support fetch](http://caniuse.com/#search=fetch)
you can polyfill it with [github/fetch](https://github.com/github/fetch).

Install the module:

```
npm i --save whatwg-fetch
```

And use it before loading this library:

```
require('whatwg-fetch')
require('web-audio-player')
```

## Roadmap

Some new features may be added to this module, such as:

- Adding a `currentTime` property
- Adding a seek or `play(N)` feature
- Adding a few more events
- Supporting pause/play with buffered sources if possible
- Supporting caching or re-using the fetch response
- Supporting a list of formats like OGG, WAV, MP3

Please open an issue or PR if you wish to discuss a new feature.

## WebAudio Gotchas

There are currently a lot of challenges with cross-platform WebAudio playback. This is likely to change soon as vendors continue fixing bugs.

- Most browsers only support a limited number of AudioContext instances; re-use them where possible.
- When using a `buffer` source that doesn't loop, the audio file will only be playable *once*! You will need to load the file again to re-play it.
- Browsers/devices which do not support `createMediaElementSource` will need to download and decode the entire audio file before it can be played.
  - There is no means of getting progress callback for the `decodeAudioData` (this is [in discussion](https://github.com/WebAudio/web-audio-api/issues/335))
- In iOS 9.2 Chrome (v45.0.2454.89), there is a bug where opening the app directly to the demo will not play any audio. The user will need to refresh the page in order to hear audio.
- iOS Safari has a bug with `sampleRate` causing playback to be distorted sometimes
  - To solve, use [ios-safe-audio-context](https://github.com/Jam3/ios-safe-audio-context)
  - Also ensure all audio/video across your site uses the same `sampleRate`
- In Chrome Android, using `buffer` and "Add to Home Screen", you can auto-play music without the need for user gesture. This is not the case with iOS "Add to Home Screen."
- In iOS Safari, the `<audio>` tag's `load()` method needs to be called; however, this just causes a second (superfluous) request for the file in most other browsers.
- In Chrome, if `load()` is called immediately after `play()`, no sound will occur until the next `play()` is called.
- In iOS Safari, audio playback must be triggered on a `'touchend'` *that isn't part of a drag action*. One solution is to attempt audio playback only when the distance and time since `'touchstart'` is less than a certain threshold; see [tap-event](https://github.com/component/tap-event).
